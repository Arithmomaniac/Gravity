1st step:
 - add reference for the "kCura.Data.RowDataGateway" assembly to Gravity and Gravity.Test project
 - add reference for the "kCura.Relativity.Client" assembly to Gravity and Gravity.Test project
 - add reference for the "Relativity.API assembly" assembly to Gravity and Gravity.Test project

2nd step:
 - install Gravity Demo application on a workspace in a Relativty instance (the installer is located in ..Gravity\Gravity.Demo\Installers Folder)

3rd step:
 - add the correct values for your Relativity instance in the App.config file of Gravity.Test project:
    - WorkspaceID - the workspace where Gravity Demo is installed
    - SQLServerHostName - server host name
    - SQLServerUsername - username for server
    - SQLServerPassword -  password for server
    - RsapiUrl - rsapi Url
    - RsapiUsername- rsapi username
    - RsapiPassword- rsapi password
    - SMTPServer - not yet implemented
    - SMTPPort - not yet implemented
    - SMTPFromEmailAddress - not yet implemented
    - SMTPUsername - not yet implemented
    - SMTPPassword - not yet implemented

4th step:
  - In order to run the tests from "RsapiDaoTest.cs" replace the value of the "rdoArtifactID" variable with the ArtifactId of the GravityLevelOne object demo instance
